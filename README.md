## Introduction

I am passionate about technology, particularly in AI, cloud computing, and software development. I have experience working with Microsoft technologies, cloud services like Azure and Office 365, and I am constantly seeking to improve my skills by applying them to real-world projects.

## Skills

- Programming Languages: Python, Java, SQL, C++, PHP
- Web Technologies: HTML, CSS
- Cloud Technologies: Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Exchange, Office 365, Active Directory
- Tools & Frameworks: Git, GitHub, PowerShell, Jupyter Notebooks
- Databases: MySQL, SQL Server

## Projects

### DocInsight

Technologies: React.js, SQL, API Development

DocInsight is a healthcare platform designed to collect and visualize data on over 500 doctors. The platform allows users to rate doctors based on their qualifications and patient feedback, improving doctor-patient matching accuracy.

- Developed a rating system that increased user satisfaction by 30%.
- Led a team of 4 developers, reducing development time by 20%.
- Managed the database using SQL and integrated with React.js for front-end visualization.

### Evolutionary Algorithm Based Feature Selection And Fusion For Facial Expression Recognition
Technologies: Python, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, Genetic Algorithms

This project uses machine learning and genetic algorithms to classify facial expressions such as happiness, sadness, and anger with high accuracy.

- Curated and pre-processed a dataset of emotive faces.
- Developed a facial detection system using HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) and local binary patterns for accurate feature extraction.
- Achieved 94.28% classification accuracy using a genetic algorithm for feature fusion.
